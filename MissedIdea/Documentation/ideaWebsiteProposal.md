User logs on to / enters site. User presses one button to show form so that they can add an idea and post it to a category. Can browse without login. Comments etc then work as they would in Facebook or other common application. Selling point to users: if your idea is good someone may make it a reality. Selling point to entrepreneurs: come and see what people would like implemented for free.

* A way for ideas to develop into more full ideas


### Ways to attract people to the site and attract them back:
* Comments
* Good UI

## Monitisation:
* Wait for the website to get traction then advertise on the site (not too much)
* Sell the site when it gets big (not massively interested in maintaining it)
* Entrepreneurs could pay us to remove an idea from the site, the more votes the more they pay. We could give users points for the number of “claimed ideas”. 


## Design:
* Simple and clear, instantly obvious how the site works
* Could have as few as 5 pages in total


## Marketing:
1. Get intelligent people involved first for high calibre ideas (Cambridge friends)
2. Ideally get it in front of as many people as possible
3. Hacker News - entrepreneurs 
4. BBC news - brand awareness
5. Viral via Facebook - brand awareness
6. Schools and university students - ideas



## Budget:
* £50 each maximum (I can host it to begin with)
