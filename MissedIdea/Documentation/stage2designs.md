* Use fiends and family as the initial seeds for the site 

## Ideas

* Limit input to 140 characters
* Have comments (also limit length to 140 chars)

## Voting 
* Wherever you can see idea you can vote for it. 
* Needed to filter out bad and offensive ideas. Also gives us more power to sort and display.
* Voting up only by highlighting an icon or picture (needs to be obvious how it works) (still consider down voting)
* Could incorporate into facebook for marketing reasons (like button) 

## Comments 

* More and less buttons to hide/show comments 
* Inline with ideas 
* Ordered chronologically (oldest first) 
* Limit length to 140 characters 

## Categories 

* Mandatory for the comitter of the idea, optional for the viewer (either look at categories or all ideas on home page)
* If the category is empty have page with "There are currently no ideas in the XYZ category, be the first to commit an idea"
followed by an add button. Always positive.
